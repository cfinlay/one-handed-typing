I'm not a Windows user myself, but Lifehacker has a comparison of remapping
utilities,
[here](https://lifehacker.com/5883003/the-best-key-remapper-for-windows).

As for foot switches, it seems that most foot switches come with a CD with
installation software for Windows, so that you can remap the foot switch to
whatever you like.

I'd like to hear if you use any of this software on a Windows machine, and
we'll update this README for others.
